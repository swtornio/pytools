# Project 1 - The Scope!

# Scenario: Congrats, your Penetration testing company Red Planet has
# landed an external assessment for Microsoft! Your point of contact has
# give you a few IP addresses for you to test. Like with any test you
# should always verify the scope given to you to make sure there wasn't
# a mistake.

## Beginner Task: Write a script that will have the user input an IP
## address. The script should output the ownership and geolocation of the
## IP. The output should be presented in a way that is clean and organized
## in order to be added to your report.

# Resources:
