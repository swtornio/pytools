# Project 1 - The Scope!

Scenario: Congrats, your Penetration testing company Red Planet has landed an external assessment for Microsoft! Your point of contact has give you a few IP addresses for you to test. Like with any test you should always verify the scope given to you to make sure there wasn't a mistake.

## Beginner Task: Write a script that will have the user input an IP address. The script should output the ownership and geolocation of the IP. The output should be presented in a way that is clean and organized in order to be added to your report.

## Intermediate Task:  Have the script read multiple IP addresses from a text file and process them all at once.

## Expert Task:Have the script read from a file containing both single IP addresses and CIDR notation, having it process it both types.

Here are your IP addresses to check:
```
131.253.12.5
131.91.4.55
192.224.113.15
199.60.28.111
```

For the Expert Task here are two networks in CIDR notation:
```
20.128.0.0/16
208.76.44.0/22
```
